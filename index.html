                <p>Hello everyone, my name is Tatiana Rend√≥n, I am from Colombia It is a beautiful country, 
                I am a BYU student andI am excited to be able to learn to program in different programming languages. <br>
                I am someone who values responsibility in all areas of my life. In the workplace, I dedicate myself to fulfilling 
                tasks with diligence and efficiency, always seeking ways to positively contribute to the team. My family holds a 
                special place in my heart, and I am always ready to offer support and dedication to maintain strong family ties.<br>
                Concerning my studies, I view education as an invaluable tool, constantly seeking ways to apply what I've learned 
                in practical situations. I am passionate about the idea of continual intellectual growth and contributing to the world 
                around me with my knowledge. <br>
                In my home, I share my life with an adorable gray cat who brightens my days with their company. Their presence adds 
                warmth and joy to my space, turning it into a cozy haven after each day.
